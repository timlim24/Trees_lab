# Trees_lab
We implemented and tested classic graph algorithms (Prim/Kruskal, Bellman–Ford/Floyd–Warshall), compared their performance with NetworkX, and ran experiments on graphs of different sizes and densities. We also built a Decision Tree classifier from scratch to see how tree-based models work in practice.
